"surprise"
"I was particularly  by the transportation of Sheikh Mezel, who had died because his brother had shot him. First, I thought it was surprising that Joseph had mentioned this fact very casually, which made me  if this was a common occurrence. Second, I was  because I didn't imagine that steamships would be transferring dead bodies."
"Yes, I was  by the variety of  and goods that were carried. Thinking about the situation it makes sense, but I was  that a coffin was being transported. I was also  that I didn't see any  of grain in the parts I read."
"Coal - does not seem like an area that would have coal mining; maybe they were importing it."
"Dead body of a sheikh. I  where do they send it with a steam ship. Also hides, where do they come from? If they were being delivered from Basra to Baghdad, weren't animals available in Baghdad for hides? Other way around, then was Basra last stop for those, or was there a hide trade on the Persian Gulf? I have the same questions for frequent  of coal and ghee. Where were they needed?"
"I was  by the diversity of the  on board, why Joseph chose to document their races, and how he knew what their purposes were for traveling on the . It is  that he mainly only describes the  in first and second class. I  if the groups of  who stayed on deck were as diverse, and I also  what the purpose of their travels were. It was mentioned that passengers would periodically be exposed to dangers, such as attacks from  living onshore. Was this dependent on the cargo they were carrying? Was this an indication of regional or cultural tensions within Ottoman Iraq? Nevertheless I think the details Joseph included in each of his  travels raise an  discussion."
"I think hearing about all the different groups of individuals that traveled along the  gave a glimpse into how multi-cultural and diverse the Ottoman Empire was, and how different peoples interacted on a daily basis, such as via "
"Yes! Despite the rough conditions and setbacks, the steamboats were nonetheless used! Persistence!"
"I don't know that I was , but I do find it  that there is such a variety in the cargo/ that were on the steamships. It seems like Joseph was able to interact with a diverse set of  as a  purser."
"The most surprising was the dead body of Sheikh Mezel of Mahomerah, shot by his brother. Perhaps it would have been  to hear more about what had taken place there, but Svoboda doesn't seem to dwell on it."
"I was  about the dead body ""who was shot dead by his brother"". Given the heat and I  about decomposition and odor."
"I was pretty  by the diversity of the groups, specifically the diversity of social class who all traveled together on the ship. In the  I observed, there was not only a huge mix of different professions who traveled together, such as government workers, political figures, doctors, etc., but also a huge variety of communities, such as Arabic , Jewish , and Christians for . Perhaps this is indicative of the cohesive diversity of the region."
