"When arriving at Amara, Joseph and company dropped off rivets, coal, tins of ghee, and lamb skins. These goods I'm assuming come from Basra and were dropped off at Amara on the way to Baghdad.","One passenger that was aboard the steamship was Dr. Z Yèronimakis who was a new inspector for Baghdad's quarantine. There was also a Jewish apothecary named Ezra Daniel who was on board because he was accompanying the dead body of Sheikh Mezel of Mahomerah.","I was particularly surprised by the transportation of Sheikh Mezel, who had died because his brother had shot him. First, I thought it was surprising that Joseph had mentioned this fact very casually, which made me wonder if this was a common occurrence. Second, I was surprised because I didn't imagine that steamships would be transferring dead bodies."
"They ship quite a wide variety of cargo such as coffins, specie, coal, hides, jam, rivets, ghee, lamb skins, and many people. This all comes from Basra and places on the way from Basra to Baghdad such as Amara, Ali Gherbi, etc.","Some of the passengers were Rezooki Angoorly Nessoory Andrea the Shahbender of the Custum House, Rezooki Sayegh & Jeboory Asfa, Rufail, Mr. Bottomley, Dr. Z Yèronimakis a New Inspector for the Quarantine of Baghdad, Ezra Daniel the Jew Apothecary, zaptyehs. It seems to be usually around 100-200 passengers.","Yes, I was surprised by the variety of people and goods that were carried. Thinking about the situation it makes sense, but I was surprised that a coffin was being transported. I was also surprised that I didn't see any mention of grain in the parts I read."
"Coal, ghee, lambskins from Amara","Inspector, doctors, politicians, dead corpse","Coal - does not seem like an area that would have coal mining; maybe they were importing it."
"Coal, ghee, lamb skins, passengers, coffins","Inspectors, sheikhs, families","Dead body of a sheikh. I wonder where do they send it with a steam ship. Also hides, where do they come from? If they were being delivered from Basra to Baghdad, weren't animals available in Baghdad for hides? Other way around, then was Basra last stop for those, or was there a hide trade on the Persian Gulf? I have the same questions for frequent mention of coal and ghee. Where were they needed?"
"Coal, bundles of hides, tins of ghee, bales of lamb skins. Goods seem to be transported from Basra to Baghdad, frequently stopping at Amara in between.","In one particular journey, there were 125 passengers total. In first class, there was an English officer traveling from Persia named Major C.S. Cumberland, who seems to be an athlete of some sort and has been traveling for eight years already. Joseph also described 2 Persian ladies who are the wives of Yacoob and Yousif, sons of Eassayi who are traveling to Basra. The third Persian is someone named H. Abdulghani Khdery, who is returning to Amara. In second class, Joseph documents an Assyrian priest, Kass Yousif ibn Georjieh, and his mother, who are ""going to replace Kass Toma Bahi"".","I was surprised by the diversity of the people on board, why Joseph chose to document their races, and how he knew what their purposes were for traveling on the steamship. It is interesting that he mainly only describes the people in first and second class. I wonder if the groups of people who stayed on deck were as diverse, and I also wonder what the purpose of their travels were. It was mentioned that passengers would periodically be exposed to dangers, such as attacks from people living onshore. Was this dependent on the cargo they were carrying? Was this an indication of regional or cultural tensions within Ottoman Iraq? Nevertheless I think the details Joseph included in each of his steamship travels raise an interesting discussion."
"There is often the shipping of coal, packages, and letters from Baghdad to Basra and vice versa, also being loaded and unloaded at various locations in the journey.","While Joseph doesn't always go into specific detail about individuals, he will describe them by ethnicity/religion. For example, he mentions ""Jews"" and ""Arabs"" boarding quite routinely","I think hearing about all the different groups of individuals that traveled along the steamship gave a glimpse into how multi-cultural and diverse the Ottoman Empire was, and how different peoples interacted on a daily basis, such as via steamship"
"Iraqi grains! People!
Iraq, Baghdad, Basra","Both individuals and groups. It was faster to travel this way.","Yes! Despite the rough conditions and setbacks, the steamboats were nonetheless used! Persistence!"
"Some examples of cargo include: coal, lab hides, ghee, rivets. A lot of it comes from the different stops along the Tigris River (Amara, Coot, etc).","There are several unnamed passengers (i.e. ""at 4am landed 2 passengers""), but Joseph often describes the first class passengers whose name he knows. These include doctors coming in to fill vacancies or new positions because of the quarantine, as well as religious and political figures. Basically, anyone who needs passage down the Tigris River.","I don't know that I was surprised, but I do find it interesting that there is such a variety in the cargo/people that were on the steamships. It seems like Joseph was able to interact with a diverse set of people as a steamship purser."
"Grain is one of the major shipments, as Iraq could be irrigated from the Tigris and Euphrates rivers","From the description of passengers, it looks like mainly individuals and small families use the steamships for many different reasons.","The most surprising was the dead body of Sheikh Mezel of Mahomerah, shot by his brother. Perhaps it would have been interesting to hear more about what had taken place there, but Svoboda doesn't seem to dwell on it."
"They shipped a body in a coffin from Basra to Baghdad. Okes(?) from Basra to Baghdad. GS Plasters from Basra to Baghdad. Draft from Basra to Baghdad.","[7:] We have altogether 109 Passenger.

"Coal, Ghee, Lamb Skin, okes, and wool. He seems to regularly ship bales of wool from the Lynches wool press. He seems to pick up most of these goods from the city of Amara.","I was able to find examples of friends, quarantine inspectors, doctors, a Jewish Apothecary, the dead body of a Sheik, and Custom House Mamoor, but I do not know what that last group means. It seems that many people in these groups are just looking for a fast means of travel between the two cities, sometimes bringing cargo.","I was pretty surprised by the diversity of the groups, specifically the diversity of social class who all traveled together on the ship. In the example I observed, there was not only a huge mix of different professions who traveled together, such as government workers, political figures, doctors, etc., but also a huge variety of communities, such as Arabic people, Jewish people, and Christians for example. Perhaps this is indicative of the cohesive diversity of the region."
