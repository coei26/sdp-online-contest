"steamships"
"One passenger that was aboard the steamship was Dr. Z Yeronimakis who was a new inspector for Baghdad's quarantine. There was also a Jewish apothecary named Ezra Daniel who was on board because he was accompanying the dead body of Sheikh Mezel of Mahomerah."
"Some of the  were Rezooki Angoorly Nessoory Andrea the Shahbender of the Custum House, Rezooki Sayegh & Jeboory Asfa, Rufail, Mr. Bottomley, Dr. Z Yeronimakis a New Inspector for the Quarantine of Baghdad, Ezra Daniel the Jew Apothecary, zaptyehs. It seems to be usually around 100-200 ."
"Inspector, doctors, politicians, dead corpse"
"Inspectors, sheikhs, families"
"In one particular journey, there were 125  total. In first class, there was an English officer traveling from Persia named Major C.S. Cumberland, who seems to be an athlete of some sort and has been traveling for eight years already. Joseph also described 2 Persian ladies who are the wives of Yacoob and Yousif, sons of Eassayi who are traveling to Basra. The third Persian is someone named H. Abdulghani Khdery, who is returning to Amara. In second class, Joseph documents an Assyrian priest, Kass Yousif ibn Georjieh, and his mother, who are ""going to replace Kass Toma Bahi""."
"While Joseph doesn't always go into specific detail about individuals, he will describe them by ethnicity/religion. For example, he mentions ""Jews"" and ""Arabs"" boarding quite routinely"
"Both individuals and groups. It was faster to travel this way."
"There are several unnamed  (i.e. ""at 4am landed 2 ""), but Joseph often describes the first class  whose name he knows. These include doctors coming in to fill vacancies or new positions because of the quarantine, as well as religious and political figures. Basically, anyone who needs passage down the Tigris River."
"From the description of , it looks like mainly individuals and small families use the steamships for many different reasons."

"I was able to find examples of friends, quarantine inspectors, doctors, a Jewish Apothecary, the dead body of a Sheik, and Custom House Mamoor, but I do not know what that last group means. It seems that many people in these groups are just looking for a fast means of travel between the two cities, sometimes bringing cargo."
