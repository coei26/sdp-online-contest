"I suppose one of the more straightforward motivations was the large amount of money involved in these deals. However, a more internal motivation may have been Géjou's desire to disseminate, honor and preserve ancient Iraqi or Mesopotamian culture, given that Géjou himself was Iraqi-French. Perhaps trading antiquities was also an act of deliberate subversion against Ottoman rule, and against the forced Westernization of Iraqi culture under the regime. In an ironic turn of events, the symbolic devaluation of Iraqi culture at the time seemed to be countered by the financial appreciation of ancient Mesopotamian cultural artifacts in the West.","Germany

"I think the immense profit that came from antiquity sales to curators in Europe was the main motivator, but it must also have been quite fun to go on this treasure hunt of sorts to find various different ancient artefacts to sell. Because this was technically illegal in 1899, it seems that maybe this opportunity was too enticing for people who needed the money to support their families/buy food, or maybe some people just wanted to travel the world, and this was a trade that allowed this.","Germany

"Considering the illegality of the practice, as well as the physical difficulty of locating and transporting delicate artifacts such as the examples linked above across countries, I would assume dealers like Gejou were most likely motivated by the profits of such an expedition.","Germany
