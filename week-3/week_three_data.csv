Kathleen Muenzen,kmuenzen@uw.edu,"I suppose one of the more straightforward motivations was the large amount of money involved in these deals. However, a more internal motivation may have been Géjou's desire to disseminate, honor and preserve ancient Iraqi or Mesopotamian culture, given that Géjou himself was Iraqi-French. Perhaps trading antiquities was also an act of deliberate subversion against Ottoman rule, and against the forced Westernization of Iraqi culture under the regime. In an ironic turn of events, the symbolic devaluation of Iraqi culture at the time seemed to be countered by the financial appreciation of ancient Mesopotamian cultural artifacts in the West.","Germany

United States",Yes
Johanna Shieh,shiehjoh@uw.edu,"Gejou wanted to be able to experience other cultures and learn more, and he was probably able to get goods that weren't accessible in Baghdad.","Spain
Italy
Turkey",Yes
Grant Yang,ley5@uw.edu,"Profitable and have chances to reach out to people from higher class. Also, trading such ancient antiquities were legal.",Germany,Yes
Andrew Look,looka@uw.edu,"My guess would be they wanted to make dizzying profits, as stated in the original article.","Spain
Italy
Turkey",Yes
Julianne Mendoza,jvdcm825@uw.edu,"I think the main motivator was to gain money. Because of their age, I'm sure that antiques ran for a very high price so it seemed like a surefire way to gain money easily and quickly.","Germany

Turkey",No
Kaarina Tulleau,kaarinat@uw.edu,"Profit probably motivated antiquity dealers like Géjou, as mentioned in the paragraphs above. Some may have also enjoyed finding artefacts in the markets of Baghdad.","Germany
United States",No
Catherine Oei,coei26@uw.edu,"I think the immense profit that came from antiquity sales to curators in Europe was the main motivator, but it must also have been quite fun to go on this treasure hunt of sorts to find various different ancient artefacts to sell. Because this was technically illegal in 1899, it seems that maybe this opportunity was too enticing for people who needed the money to support their families/buy food, or maybe some people just wanted to travel the world, and this was a trade that allowed this.","Germany
United States",Yes
Sam Fields,fields8@uw.edu,"Considering the illegality of the practice, as well as the physical difficulty of locating and transporting delicate artifacts such as the examples linked above across countries, I would assume dealers like Gejou were most likely motivated by the profits of such an expedition.","Germany
