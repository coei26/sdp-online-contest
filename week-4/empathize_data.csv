"Well both  and I are definitely very used to quarantines.  he probably never went through a pandemic of  scale of COVID."
"It did not seem   was stressed out by all  ,  aware of what was going on. Quarantine is something that has been going on a long time. It is amazing that  year is   first time in my life that I have been inconvenienced by a quarantine."
"I  relate to  because of  similarities of his situation and  current pandemic.  aspect of waiting and hearing of acquaintances getting ill and dying.  differences are related to  diseases. Unfortunately,  diseases were mainly bacterial so were more localized while  current pandemic is viral and more widespread because of how it is transmitted."
"Something that I could relate to with  was that it seemed   idea of quarantining was relatively normal to him. He doesn't  treat it as a crazy phenomenon in  diaries,  a normal part of life. Unfortunately,  pandemic has been going on for so long that I, too, feel that sense of normalcy when thinking about our current situation."
"There are many instances describing how worries about   cause people to leave cities and two passages in D47 that I reached searching for keyword ""fever"" that reflects 's frustration. Both refer to  spike of   in Baghdad (page 260, line 19 ff, p. 262, line 25 ff). Also,  implies a curious connection between   and not moving to  ""top of  house"" out of fear of catching it (p. 261):
[15:] I came home; I took
[16:] a warm bath; weather
[17:] getting warm; no body has
[18:]  gone to sleep on  top
[19:] of  house, on account
[20:] of  sickness, fever & some
[21:] sort of influenza~"
"  to have a very detached view of , at least from  passages that I read. He speaks about  numbers of individuals sick or dead, and  days that he is forced to wait as his ship is stuck behind those quarantining. Today, arguably due to  breadth of technology available and  ease of accessing global news, hearing about  has a  more personal impact."
"I  we  all relate to  idea of quarantine, considering  conditions of  last year. My mail isn't fumigated,  my family and I do take precautions with objects/food entering our house. A difference is that  continues to travel during periods when infectious diseases were an issue,  I have been staying at home in an effort to avoid COVID."
"As seen throughout  diary entries, infectious  caused people at  time a great burden by complicating all facets of work.  is comparable to  modern COVID pandemic as  current pandemic has forced individuals to adapt to a new lifestyle where all aspects of work, travel, and life in general are vastly different than pre-pandemic. 
I would infer that one of  biggest differences between Josephs  and my  with  pandemic is  dissemination of information. In modern day society. we are better equipped to both study an outbreak and determine courses of action to handle such events. Modern day methods of communication have enabled widespread dissemination of these findings,  back in Josephs time, understanding these outbreaks was   less grounded in science and disseminating findings about these diseases was  an arduous process.
An ironic similarity I found was in Diary 47 on page 29,  discusses  dismissing of investigative individuals for political reasons,    last presidential administration in  United States."
"As mentioned above, it  that there was a constant awareness of and perhaps accounting of quarantine in 's life. I imagine that  would have been true for many  year -- that there was a need to take into consideration quarantine practices as one goes about their daily routines. While I did  as , I  in some ways my daily routines became less complex over time due to  reduced sphere of activity."
"I could resonate with feelings of anxiousness and increased rules/procedures. Adjusting to staying within living quarters. I did not encounter sick or deceased people personally. I  did not pay attention to  weather in such extreme detail."
"We both have been quarantined and have not liked it."
